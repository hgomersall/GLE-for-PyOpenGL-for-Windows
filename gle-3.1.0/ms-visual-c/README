
This directory contains projects files for building
GLE with the Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Workspace.

Built libraries will be located in the lib-folder. The Debug-version is named gled.lib and the release-version gle.lib. Both are compiled using the run-time libraries "Debug Multithreaded DLL" and "Multithreaded DLL".

When the library is built an include/GL directory will be created and the gle.h file from the src directory will be copied into it. To use the library in other projects add the directory ...\gle\ms-visual-c\include to the include-directory list in Visual Studio in the Tools/Options/Directories settings.
